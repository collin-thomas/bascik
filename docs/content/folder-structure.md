### Custom 404 Page

If you create a `404.html` file in your pages directory (e.g. `src/pages/404.html`), Bascik's built-in development server will automatically serve it as a fallback for any non-existent routes with a `404` status code.

When you build your site for production (`bascik --build`), this file is compiled to `dist/404.html`, which is the standard location recognized by most static hosting providers (such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Pages) to serve custom 404 pages.
