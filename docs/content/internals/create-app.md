# Create App

The `create/` folder is a small standalone package that scaffolds a fresh Bascik project. It is separate from the main package because it is meant to be run as a user-facing CLI, not as a workspace dependency.

## Why it is separate

The repo root uses Yarn workspaces. The package code lives in `pkg/`, while the scaffold lives in `create/` and is installed like a normal Node tool.

That split keeps the monorepo dev flow simple and keeps the generated project familiar for normal users.

## Code structure

The package has two source files with distinct responsibilities:

- `create/src/scaffold.ts`: pure data and file-writing logic. All generated file content lives here as exported string constants and functions. No I/O beyond `fs/promises`. This is what the tests cover.
- `create/src/index.ts`: the CLI entry point. Handles prompts, the `-y` flag, and spawns `npm install` / `npm run dev`. Not unit-tested.

Keeping them split means you can test every generated file without invoking the CLI or touching the filesystem.

## What the CLI generates

Running `npx create-bascik <name>` writes this structure:

```text
<name>/
  package.json
  bascik.config.ts
  .gitignore
  .github/skills/bascik/SKILL.md
  .claude/skills/bascik/SKILL.md
  src/
    pages/
      index.html
      about.html
      contact.html
      404.html
      css/
        styles.css
    components/
      site-meta/
        site-meta.html
      site-header/
        site-header.html
        site-header.css
      site-footer/
        site-footer.html
        site-footer.css
      feat-card/
        feat-card.html
        feat-card.css
      my-counter/
        my-counter.html
        my-counter.css
```

The `feat-card` component demonstrates named slots. The `my-counter` component demonstrates scoped JS with two independent instances on the home page.

After scaffolding, the CLI offers to run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Both prompts can be skipped with `-y`.

## Why the generated app uses npm

The scaffold runs `npm install` and `npm run dev` so users do not need Yarn or pnpm to get started. The repo itself uses Yarn workspaces for contributor work, but the generated site is designed to feel like a regular app from a standard Node CLI.

## Modifying the scaffold

All generated file content is defined as string constants in `scaffold.ts`. To change what a new project looks like, edit the relevant constant there. After any change, rebuild before testing:

```sh
cd create
npm run build
```

The `npm link` symlink points at the `create/` directory, so a fresh `dist/` is picked up immediately without relinking. `npm link` also runs `prepare`, which copies the latest SKILL.md from docs and rebuilds `dist/`, so the initial link after a fresh checkout needs no separate build step.

## Tests

The scaffold is fully unit-tested. Run the tests from the `create/` directory:

```sh
cd create
npm test
```

Tests mock `fs/promises` and verify that every expected file is written with the right content. If you add or rename a generated file, add a corresponding test case in `scaffold.test.ts`.

## Lockfiles and package managers

Contributors use Yarn at the monorepo root with `yarn.lock`.

Generated projects intentionally use npm, and each generated project gets its own `package-lock.json`.

## Testing create app locally

From the repo root, run:

```sh
yarn create:test-site
```

This automatically builds `create-bascik` (copying the latest `SKILL.md` from `docs/`), runs the scaffolding CLI to create `my-site/`, installs its dependencies, and starts the dev server.

The `-y` flag skips both prompts. The npm install will print a 404 error for `@bascik/bascik` (not on npm yet), but the dev server starts anyway; the workspace `node_modules` symlink resolves the package. Command+Click the URL to open it in a browser.

```text
Server running at https://localhost:8443
```

## Cleanup after local testing

Once you are done, unlink to return to the normal published package flow.

From the repo root:

```sh
cd create
npm unlink
```

If you are still actively iterating on the generator, leaving it linked is fine.
