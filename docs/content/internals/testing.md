# Testing Internals

Bascik has two separate test suites: **unit tests** (Vitest) that verify individual library modules, and **end-to-end tests** (Playwright) that build and browser-test the full transpilation pipeline against a fixture site.

## Running Unit Tests

Commands can be run per-package or across the workspace from the repository root:

```sh
# Workspace-wide unit tests
yarn unit:all

# Package-specific unit tests (single run)
yarn pkg:unit       # @bascik/bascik
yarn create:unit    # create-bascik
yarn docs:unit      # bascik-docs
yarn ext:unit       # bascik-vscode

# Interactive watch mode (pkg)
yarn pkg:test

# Single run with coverage
yarn pkg:coverage
yarn create:coverage
yarn docs:coverage
yarn ext:coverage
yarn coverage:all   # update coverage across all packages

# Benchmarks
yarn pkg:bench
```

## Running E2E Tests

End-to-end tests are run via:

```sh
# Static production server suite
yarn pkg:e2e

# Documentation site Lighthouse CLI audit suite
yarn docs:lighthouse

# Dev server suite (runs full E2E test suite + live-reload tests against bascik --dev)
yarn pkg:e2e:dev

# Production server suite (runs both HTTP/1.1 cleartext and HTTP/2 TLS server script tests against bascik --serve)
yarn pkg:e2e:prod

# Or run HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 prod server suites individually:
yarn pkg:e2e:prod:http1
yarn pkg:e2e:prod:http2
```

This builds the fixture site (using the current `dist/`) and then runs Playwright against it. The first run requires the package to be built first:

```sh
yarn pkg:build && yarn pkg:e2e
```

To run a specific test file or use the Playwright UI:

```sh
# Run only CSS scoping tests against static server
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts e2e/tests/css-scoping.test.ts

# Run dev server live-reload tests against bascik --dev
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.dev.config.ts e2e/tests/dev-server-reload.test.ts

# Run HTTP/1.1 prod server tests against bascik --serve
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.server.config.ts e2e/tests/prod-server.test.ts

# Run HTTP/2 prod server tests against bascik --serve
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.server-http2.config.ts e2e/tests/prod-server.test.ts

# Open the Playwright UI for interactive debugging
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts --ui
```

## How the E2E Suite Works

The e2e fixture is a small but complete Bascik project at `pkg/e2e/`:

```text
pkg/e2e/
  bascik.config.ts                ← fixture config (minify.identifiers: false)
  playwright.config.ts            ← static build test runner
  playwright.server.config.ts      ← HTTP/1.1 cleartext prod server runner
  playwright.server-http2.config.ts← HTTP/2 TLS prod server runner
  playwright.dev.config.ts        ← dev server runner for live-reload and open-page priority
  server.ts                       ← minimal static HTTP server for dist/
  src/
    pages/                        ← one HTML page per feature under test
    components/                   ← components used by those pages
  tests/                          ← Playwright test files
```

The E2E suite supports four execution modes:

1. **Static production suite (`playwright.config.ts`)**: builds the fixture site with `bascik --build` and serves static files via `server.ts` on port 4200.
2. **HTTP/1.1 production server suite (`playwright.server.config.ts`)**: boots cleartext `bascik --serve` over HTTP/1.1 on port 9443 to test `data-bascik-server` request-time script execution and cleartext server behavior.
3. **HTTP/2 production server suite (`playwright.server-http2.config.ts`)**: boots TLS-enabled `bascik --serve` over HTTP/2 on port 9444 to test `data-bascik-server` request-time script execution and encrypted server behavior.
4. **Dev server watch suite (`playwright.dev.config.ts`)**: boots `bascik --dev` on port 8080 to run the full test suite and live-reload watcher tests directly against the live dev server with SSE tracking and open-page priority re-transpilation.

Tests navigate to pages on the active server and assert against the live browser DOM.

## Fixture Design

`minify.identifiers` is kept at `false` in the fixture config so Playwright selectors can use readable scoped names like `bascik__my-comp__btn`. The only non-default values set are the site URL and the production server port:

```ts
// pkg/e2e/bascik.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@bascik/bascik/config';

export default defineConfig({
  siteUrl: 'http://localhost:4200',
  useWorkers: true,
  serve: { port: 9443 },
});
```

Each fixture page renders two or more instances of the component under test so isolation can be verified, changes to instance A must not affect instance B.

### Compiler Verification vs. Application Functional Tests

When designing and updating end-to-end tests, a clear distinction must be maintained between the compiler-level assertions and application-level behavior tests:

* **Compiler Verification (`pkg/e2e/tests/`):** These tests explicitly verify that Bascik's scoping and compilation rules transpile and rewrite selectors correctly. As a result, they deliberately select and assert against exact compiled class names (e.g., `.bascik__my-comp__wrapper`) and rewritten component IDs (e.g., `[id$="__btn"]`). They must not use `data-testid` properties because doing so would bypass the verification of the scoping engine itself.
* **Application Functional Tests (`docs/e2e/`):** These tests verify that application widgets (like the documentation site's interactive demos, counters, and search panel) perform user-facing actions correctly. Because the documentation site is built in production mode with identifier minification enabled (`minify.identifiers: true`), raw classes and IDs are hashed and compressed. To prevent brittle tests that break upon minification, these tests must target elements using standard `data-testid` attributes or accessible roles (e.g., `page.getByTestId(...)`, `page.getByRole(...)`).

## Test Files

Each test file is paired with a fixture page. See the full list on [GitHub](https://github.com/bascikdev/bascik/tree/main/pkg/e2e/tests).

## Writing a New E2E Test

1. **Add a fixture component** in `pkg/e2e/src/components/my-feature/` with an HTML file (and CSS/JS as needed).
2. **Add a fixture page** in `pkg/e2e/src/pages/my-feature-test.html` that renders two or more instances of the component.
3. **Add a test file** at `pkg/e2e/tests/my-feature.test.ts`.

A typical test file:

```ts
import { test, expect, type Locator } from '@playwright/test';

function getInstance(page, n: number): Locator {
  return page.locator('.bascik__my-feature__wrapper').nth(n);
}

test.describe('my-feature-test page', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/my-feature-test');
  });

  test('instances are isolated', async ({ page }) => {
    const a = getInstance(page, 0);
    const b = getInstance(page, 1);
    // assert that state in A does not affect B
  });
});
```

> **Rebuild before testing.** Playwright tests run against `e2e/dist/`, which is built from the current `pkg/dist/`. If you change `pkg/src/`, run `yarn build` before `yarn e2e` so the fixture picks up the latest transpiler.

## Test Configuration

Vitest is configured in `pkg/vite.config.js`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    include: ["src/**/*.test.ts"],
    benchmark: {
      include: ["bench/**/*.bench.ts"],
    },
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
      reporter: ["text", "json-summary", "lcov"],
      reportsDirectory: "./coverage",
      include: ["src/**/*.js"],
      exclude: ["src/**/*.test.ts"],
    },
  },
});
```

Coverage is collected via V8 and written to `pkg/coverage/`. The CI script uses `text-summary` only. The full HTML report at `coverage/index.html` is useful locally.

## Test Files

Each library module has a paired test file. See the full list on [GitHub](https://github.com/bascikdev/bascik/tree/main/pkg/src/lib).

## Writing Tests

Tests use the standard Vitest `describe` / `it` / `expect` API. Because library modules depend on `BascikConfig` (a module-level singleton), tests that need a specific configuration use `vi.mock` to stub it:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";

vi.mock("../config.ts", () => ({
  BascikConfig: {
    scopeScriptBlocks: true,
    scopeAttribute: { class: true, id: true, name: true },
    isBuild: false,
    minify: { css: false, identifiers: false },
  },
}));

// Import the module under test AFTER mocking its dependencies
import { prefixElementAttribute } from "./javascript.js";

describe("prefixElementAttribute", () => {
  it("scopes class attributes in HTML", () => {
    const component = {
      name: "my-comp",
      fileContent: '<div class="btn">Click</div>',
    };
    const result = prefixElementAttribute(component, "class", "abc123");
    expect(result.fileContent).toContain("bascik__my-comp__btn");
  });
});
```

<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Always import the module under test <em>after</em> calling <code>vi.mock</code>. Vitest hoists mock calls to the top of the file, but the import order still matters for ensuring the mock is in place when the module initializes its dependencies.</p>
</div>

## Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks live in `pkg/bench/` and use Vitest's built-in `bench` API. They measure the transpilation pipeline on fixed, repeatable inputs:

```ts
import { bench, describe } from "vitest";
import { recursivelyTranspile } from "../src/lib/processing.ts";

describe("recursivelyTranspile", () => {
  bench("simple page - one component", () => {
    recursivelyTranspile(simpleHtml, componentList);
  });

  bench("complex page - nested components", () => {
    recursivelyTranspile(complexHtml, componentList);
  });
});
```

## TypeScript Checking

Run type checking across all packages or for individual packages from the repository root:

```sh
# Type check all packages
yarn typecheck:all

# Package-specific type checks
yarn pkg:typecheck
yarn create:typecheck
yarn docs:typecheck
yarn ext:typecheck
```

## Monorepo Aggregator Commands

The root `package.json` provides aggregated tasks across all projects:

* `yarn typecheck:all`: runs typechecks across `pkg`, `create`, `docs`, and `extensions/vscode-bascik`
* `yarn check:all`: runs spelling (`check:spelling`) and web standards (`check:standards`)
* `yarn unit:all`: runs unit test suites across all packages
* `yarn e2e:all`: runs Playwright E2E suites (`pkg:e2e:all` and `docs:e2e`)
* `yarn coverage:all`: generates and updates coverage reports across all packages
* `yarn test:all`: runs `typecheck:all`, `check:all`, `unit:all`, `e2e:all`, and `docs:lighthouse` in sequence (coverage excluded)
