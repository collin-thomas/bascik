# Server Architecture

Bascik's server infrastructure powers both local development (`bascik`) and per-request production serving (`bascik --serve`). Designed as a modular 4-tier pipeline, the server handles request routing, static file serving, `data-bascik-server` request script execution, live reload SSE streams, in-memory caching, and security hardening.

## Modular Architecture (`server.ts`, `http.ts`, `http2.ts`, `pki.ts`)

Bascik separates protocol management from request routing using a 4-tier architecture:

                  [HTTP Response]
```

1. **`server.ts`**: Central server orchestrator. Defines the unified `createRequestHandler()` routing pipeline, `startServerInstance()` port binder, rate limiter, security header handler, and top-level `startServer()` dispatcher.
2. **`http.ts`**: Plaintext HTTP/1.1 server (`node:http`). Wraps `http.IncomingMessage` and `http.ServerResponse` into Bascik's request context.
3. **`http2.ts`**: Opt-in encrypted HTTP/2 server (`node:http2`). Wraps `ServerHttp2Stream` into Bascik's request context.
4. **`pki.ts`**: Generates self-signed TLS certificates when `enableTls: true` is configured and certificate files are missing on disk.

## Plaintext HTTP/1.1 Default vs HTTP/2 TLS

Plaintext HTTP/1.1 is active by default because it works instantly across all local development tools and integrated browsers without untrusted certificate warnings or platform trust setup.

For production HTTP/2 protocol parity during local development, enable TLS in `bascik.config.ts`:

```ts
export default {
  serve: {
    enableTls: true, // Server boots over https://localhost:8443 (HTTP/2)
  },
};
```

When `enableTls: true` is active, `pki.ts` looks for local `bascik-cert.pem` and `bascik-privkey.pem` files. If missing, it attempts to generate CA-trusted certificates using `mkcert` (if available) or falls back to OpenSSL self-signed certificates.

## Development Server Mode (`bascik`)

During local development, `bascik` compiles pages into memory and starts the watch and live-reload systems.

### In-memory page store (`mem.ts`)

The `MemoryStore` class manages rendered pages during development without writing intermediate files to disk on every edit:

- `#files`: Maps HTTP paths (such as `/getting-started`) to `StoredPage` objects containing raw HTML buffers, pre-compressed Brotli buffers, and component usage lists.
- `#components`: Inverted index mapping each component name to the `Set<string>` of page paths using it. This index enables selective re-transpilation when a single component changes.
- `#openPages`: Tracks active SSE live-reload connections. Pages currently open in a browser tab are transpiled first during batch rebuilds so visible tabs refresh immediately.

Brotli compression during development uses minimum quality (`BROTLI_MIN_QUALITY = 1`) for instant background compression without clogging Node.js C++ threadpool workers.

### Boot page during startup (`boot-page.ts`)

The development server binds its port immediately while page transpilation runs asynchronously. Requests arriving before a page finishes transpiling receive a lightweight boot page displaying a spinner and status message.

The boot page connects to `/bascik-live-reload`. When the requested page finishes transpiling, the `"transpiled"` event fires, the SSE connection receives a reload signal, and the browser fetches the actual page automatically. Once `watchFiles()` completes the initial build, the `isBooting` flag is cleared and unmatched paths fall through to 404 handling. The boot page is never used in production mode.

### Watch system (`watch.ts`)

Three native filesystem watchers (chokidar) handle source file updates:

1. **Static assets watcher:** Copies non-HTML files in `pages/` to `dist/` on `add` or `change`, deletes them on `unlink`, and triggers a live-reload event.
2. **Page HTML watcher:** Listens for `.html` file changes in `pages/`. Triggers full or single-page transpilation and updates `MemoryStore`.
3. **Component watcher:** Listens for changes in `components/`. On change or deletion, uses the inverted component index (`#components`) to selectively rebuild only affected pages.

### Live reload (`live-reload.ts`)

Live reload uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) via `GET /bascik-live-reload`. Bascik injects a lightweight SSE client script into HTML pages in development mode. The script listens for `reload` messages, auto-reconnects on browser tab focus or visibility changes, and cleanly closes streams on page unload. Production builds strip this script entirely.

## Production Server Mode (`bascik --serve`)

When launched with `bascik --serve` or `BASCIK_PROD_SERVER=1`, Bascik runs as a production HTTP server (`serve.ts`).

### Serving from `dist/`

Production mode skips file watchers, live-reload injection, and in-memory page storage. Instead, it serves static files and HTML directly from the `dist/` directory generated by `bascik --build`.

### Per-request `data-bascik-server` execution (`server-scripts.ts`)

Pages containing `<script data-bascik-server>` blocks are executed on every request:

1. **Request context packaging:** Bascik packages request details (`path`, `method`, `headers`, `searchParams`) into a JSON object set as `process.env.BASCIK_REQUEST`.
2. **Isolated child process execution:** Server scripts run as Node.js ESM modules in isolated child processes with top-level `await` and `import` support.
3. **Stdout injection:** The script's `stdout` output replaces the `<script data-bascik-server>` tag in the response HTML.
4. **Source remapping:** Exceptions and stack traces are remapped back to source HTML filenames and line numbers (`stack-trace.ts`).

### Caching and performance (`cacheHttp`)

Production mode enables `cacheHttp: true` by default:

- **ETag support:** Generates strong ETag hashes for HTML responses and returns `304 Not Modified` when the client's `if-none-match` header matches.
- **Cache-Control headers:** Adds `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` to static assets.
- **Max-quality Brotli compression:** Uses `BROTLI_MAX_QUALITY = 11` for optimal bandwidth savings.

### Production rate limiting

Production mode enforces a rate limit of **500 requests per 10-second window per IP address**. Clients exceeding the limit receive `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. Rate limiting is inactive during development mode.

## Development vs Production Comparison

| Capability | Development (`bascik`) | Production (`bascik --serve`) |
|---|---|---|
| Entry Module | `transpile.ts` | `serve.ts` |
| Page Storage | `MemoryStore` in memory (`mem.ts`) | Pre-built files in `dist/` |
| Brotli Quality | `BROTLI_MIN_QUALITY = 1` | `BROTLI_MAX_QUALITY = 11` |
| HTTP Caching | Disabled (`cacheHttp: false`) | Enabled (`cacheHttp: true` with ETags & 304s) |
| Rate Limiting | Disabled | Active (500 req / 10s per IP) |
| Live Reload SSE | Injected & active | Stripped & inactive |
| File Watchers | Active for assets, pages, components | Inactive |
| Boot Page | Active during initial build | Disabled |
| `data-bascik-server` Execution | On-demand per request | Per request |

## Shared Security & Reliability

Both development and production server modes share core security and lifecycle mechanisms:

### Security response headers

Every response includes standard security headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `x-content-type-options` | `nosniff` |
| `x-frame-options` | `SAMEORIGIN` |
| `referrer-policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `permissions-policy` | `interest-cohort=()` |

### Path traversal protection

Static asset requests are normalized and validated to ensure the resolved path remains strictly within the `dist/` directory. Requests attempting path traversal via `/../` receive an immediate `400 Bad Request` response before file I/O occurs.

### Graceful shutdown

The server registers signal handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. Upon receiving a signal, it stops accepting new connections, closes active SSE streams, destroys HTTP/2 sessions, shuts down filesystem watchers, and exits cleanly within a 10-second grace period.

## E2E Server Testing

Server behavior is validated through Playwright E2E suites across four environment configurations:

- `playwright.dev.config.ts`: Dev server (`bascik`) live reload, watchers, and boot page.
- `playwright.server.config.ts`: Production server (`bascik --serve`) over HTTP/1.1.
- `playwright.server-http2.config.ts`: Production server over encrypted HTTP/2 (HTTPS).
- `playwright.config.ts`: Static build output serving.
